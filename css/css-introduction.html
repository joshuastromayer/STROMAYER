                Welcome to the start of your journey into the world of <strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong>! CSS is a language designed to make web pages visually appealing, organized, and responsive. It's the magic that transforms raw HTML into something beautiful and engaging. In this course, you'll learn how to bring your HTML content to life with the power of CSS.
            </p>
        
            <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
            <p>
                CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to style and layout web pages. While HTML provides the structure and content of a webpage, CSS defines how it looks. With CSS, you can control:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Colors, fonts, and text styles.</li>
                <li>Spacing between elements (margins and padding).</li>
                <li>Backgrounds and borders.</li>
                <li>Layouts, such as grids and flexbox.</li>
                <li>Animations and transitions.</li>
                <li>Responsive designs for different screen sizes.</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h3>Why Learn CSS?</h3>
            <p>
                CSS is an essential skill for any web developer. It allows you to:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create visually appealing and professional-looking web pages.</li>
                <li>Improve the user experience by making web pages easier to navigate and interact with.</li>
                <li>Build responsive designs that adapt to different devices, from desktops to smartphones.</li>
                <li>Express your creativity and make your websites unique.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                With CSS, the possibilities are endless. Whether you're creating a personal blog, an e-commerce site, or an interactive web application, CSS is a crucial tool in your development toolkit.
            </p>
        
            <h3>How Does CSS Work with HTML?</h3>
            <p>
                CSS works hand-in-hand with HTML. While HTML structures the content of your webpage, CSS styles it. For example:
            </p>
            <div class="code-example-html">
                <code>
                    &lt;!-- HTML --&gt;<br>
                    &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;<br><br>
                    &lt;!-- CSS --&gt;<br>
                    p {<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;color: blue;<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;font-size: 20px;<br>
                    }
                </code>
            </div>
            <p>
                The above example will style the paragraph to have blue text and a font size of 20 pixels. You'll learn all about how to write and apply CSS throughout this course.
            </p>
